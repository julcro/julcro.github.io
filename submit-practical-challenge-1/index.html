    <h1>Universal Design for Learning</h1>
    <p>Universal Design for Learning is derived from the architectual principle of Universal Design which is creating spaces that are accessible for all. Universal Design for Learning works from the belief that sometimes the learning environment is what is preventing students from learning and so instructors must do their part to ensure that students can access learning given whatever situation they come from.</p>
