    <title>Drum & Bass - DnB</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Drum & Bass - DnB</h1>
    <p>Drum and Bass (DnB), a dynamic sub-genre within the electronic music spectrum, emerged from the vibrant UK rave scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. It evolved from the fusion of various musical influences, notably Jamaican dub, reggae, hip-hop, and early electronic styles like acid house and techno. Characterized by its breakneck rhythms, deep basslines, and intricate percussion, drum and bass quickly garnered a dedicated following for its high-energy sound and infectious beats. Originating primarily in London, its roots are deeply intertwined with the city's multicultural landscape and the innovative spirit of its underground music scene. Over the years, drum and bass has evolved and diversified, influencing a myriad of other musical genres while maintaining its reputation as a driving force in electronic music culture. </p>

    <p>While DnB in and of itself is a sub-genre of electronic music - now commonly referred to as EDM (electronic dance music). There are multiple sub-genres within the broad genre itself adding to the diversity and complexity of the genre as a whole. </p>
