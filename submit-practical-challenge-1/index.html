    <h1>Universal Design for Learning</h1>
    <p>Universal Design for Learning is derived from the architectual principle of Universal Design which is creating spaces that are accessible for all. Universal Design for Learning works from the belief that sometimes the learning environment is what is preventing students from learning and so instructors must do their part to ensure that students can access learning given whatever situation they come from.</p>
    <h2>The Three Guiding Principles of UDL</h2>
    <p>UDL encourages teachers and course designers to provide students with multiple means of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engagement: For purposeful, motivated learners, stimulate interest and motivation for learning. </li>
        <li>Representation: For resourceful, knowledgeable learners, present information and content in different ways.</li>
        <li>Action & Expression:  For strategic, goal-directed learners, differentiate the ways that students can express what they know.</li>
    </ul>
    <small>The descriptions of the guidelines above were copied directly from the University of Washington (UW) website article, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/doit/universal-design-process-principles-and-applications" target="_blank">Universal Design: Process, Principles, and Applications</a> under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en" target="_blank">Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Deed</a>  </small>
    <h2>The 8 Specific Guidelines</h2>
    <p>UDL is about providing options. Here are the eight specific areas that educators are encouraged to keep in mind as they design educational experiences:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Perception</li>
        <li>Language and Symbols</li>
        <li>Comprehension</li>
        <li>Physical Action</li>
        <li>Expression and Communication</li>
        <li>Executive Functions</li>
        <li>Recruiting Interest</li>
        <li>Sustaining Effort and Persistence</li>
        <li>Self Regulation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For a detailed look at each of these, the UDL Guidelines are available for viewing or download on <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/" target="_blank">the CAST website</a>. </p>
